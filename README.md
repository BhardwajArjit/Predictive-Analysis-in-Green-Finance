# **Predictive Analysis in Green Finance**

## Overview

This project focuses on conducting an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of green energy worldwide spanning the years 1965 to 2022. The analysis is designed to unveil key trends in the SP 500 ESG Risk Rating for green finance stocks, providing insights into global and country-wise patterns. Furthermore, the project employs quantitative analysis and regression models to make precise predictions, evaluates climate risk management on both country and city levels, and utilizes classification algorithms to predict investment decisions, complete with a rationale for each judgment.
